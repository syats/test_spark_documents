Article 4
With a view to facilitating the implementation of the agreement on pre-shipment
inspection of the WTO, Member States shall verify whether the notified activities meet at
least the following conditions:
a. when they notify their activities, the pre-shipment entities shall communicate to the
authorities of the Member State(s) the dispositions, with the exception of the
remuneration, of the contract agreed with the governments or public entities of third
countries for the account of which the pre-shipment inspection programmes have
been put in place. They shall subsequently communicate all modifications regarding
the conditions for control to these same authorities. The competent authorities of the
Member States shall verify that the dispositions of the contract are not contrary to
the conditions of this directive.
b. Prior to any control, the pre-shipment inspection entity informs the exporter of the
modalities of the inspection and the criteria that will be applied.
The pre-shipment inspection entity shall carry out the appropriate controls in a time
span that avoids unreasonable delays. They shall also, following receipt of the final
documents and completion of the inspection, within five working days, either issue a
Clean Report of Findings or provide a detailed written explanation specifying the
reasons for non-issuance. In the latter case exporters shall be given the opportunity
to present their views in writing and, if exporters so request, arrange for reinspection
at the earliest mutually convenient date.
Pre-shipment inspection entities shall also undertake, whenever so requested by the
exporter, prior to the date of physical inspection, a preliminary verification of price
and, where applicable, of currency exchange rate, on the basis of the contract
between exporter and importer, the pro forma invoice and, where applicable, the
application for import authorisation. They shall, after a preliminary verification has
taken place, immediately inform exporters in writing either of their acceptance or of
their detailed reasons for non-acceptance of the price and/or currency exchange rate.
In order to avoid delays in payment, pre-shipment inspection entities shall send to
exporters or to designated representatives of the exporters a Clean Report of
Findings as expeditiously as possible. They shall.also, in the event of a clerical error
in the Clean Report of Findings, correct the error and forward the corrected
information to the appropriate parties as expeditiously as possible.
c. The pre-shipment inspections shall be carried out in a non-discriminatory manner,
and the procedures and criteria employed in the conduct of these activities shall be
objective and applied on an equal basis to all exporters affected by such activities.
d. Pre-shipment inspection entities shall not request exporters to provide information
regarding manufacturing data related to patented, licensed or undisclosed processes,
or to processes for which a patent is pending; unpublished technical data other than
data necessary to demonstrate compliance with technical regulations or standards;
internal pricing, including manufacturing costs; profit levels; the terms of contracts
between exporters and their suppliers unless it is not otherwise possible for the
entity to conduct the inspection in question. (In such cases, the entity shall only
request the information necessary for this purpose).
^\5
In general, pre-shipment inspection entities shall treat all information provided by
exporters as business confidential, to the extent that such information is not already
published, generally available to third parties, or otherwise in the public domain.
Such business confidential information shall be shared with the governments
contracting or mandating the entity only to the extent that such information is
customarily required for letters of credit or other forms or payment or for customs,
import licensing or exchange control purposes.
e. Pre-shipment inspection entities shall establish procedures to receive, consider and
render decisions concerning grievances raised by the exporters. These procedures
shall be developed and maintained in accordance with the following guidelines:

maintain a pre-shipment inspection an administrative office to receive, consider
and render decisions on exporters' appeals or grievances;

grievances and shall render a decision as soon as possible after receipt of the
