 Fair-trade provisions
The negotiations on dumping and subsidies produced far-reaching changes to the Codes
that emerged from the Tokyo Round. In order to comply with its commitments in this
area, the Community will have to adopt new legislation and amend Regulation (EEC) No
2423/88 and Regulations (EC) Nos 521/94 and 522/94.
The reasons for the proposed changes are set out in detail in the sections on dumping and
subsidies in the annex to this decision.
The Uruguay Round negotiations also produced a new agreement specifically on
safeguards. In order to comply with its commitments in this field, the Community will
have to adopt a new regulation and repeal Council Regulation (EC) No 518/94 on
common rules for imports. The grounds for this conclusion are set out in the annex.
The new GATT codes and the changes designed to streamline and rationalize the
Community's decision-making procedures should further strengthen our hand against
illicit commercial practices and resulting damage to trade. The procedures laid down in
Council Regulation (EEC) No 2641/84, as recently amended by Council Regulation (EC)
No 522/94, accordingly need to be tightened up.
7. Services
The Uruguay Round produced two new developments in the field of international trade
in services.
The first is the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), which establishes a
binding framework regulating all measures covered by the agreement. Underpinning the
rules in question are the GATT principles of non-discrimination and transparency.
The GATS contains sectoral annexes on the movement of natural persons, air transport,
telecommunications, financial services and maritime transport, which adapt the GATS
provisions to the specific features of the sectors concerned.
The schedule of initial liberalization commitments, which spells out the contracting
parties' commitments as regards national treatment and/or market access in all services
sectors, forms an integral part of the obligations imposed by the GATS.
The Community approach in this area of negotiations was a function of progress in the
creation of the Single Market, and consisted of translating its internal achievements in this
field to the multilateral stage. The commitments into which it has entered do not exceed
the obligations already imposed by the creation of the Single Market, and consequently
do not entail any changes to current Community legislation.
8. Intellectual property
The Community's other main priority for the Uruguay Round was the creation of an
efficient instrument to ensure that those intellectual property rights with implications for
trade are genuinely enforced.
A
The Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) fully
satisfies this requirement, in that it contains provisions on the protection of intellectual
property rights that together make up a body of multilateral rules designed to promote
international trade in products bearing such rights and to prevent the trade distortions and
frictions that arise from the lack of adequate and effective protection.
In addition to the general provisions and basic principles governing the protection of
intellectual property rights, the TRIPs Agreement contains binding rules guaranteeing the
existence, scope and protection of copyright and associated rights, trade marks,
geographical indications, industrial models and designs, patents, and semi-conductor layout
designs, plus rules for the protection of business secrets and the control of anticompetitive
licensing practices.
There are also detailed provisions on implementation of the TRIPs Agreement by national
authorities. These provisions cover border procedures, which must meet certain specific
requirements, the acquisition and retention of rights, and the procedures by which the
holders of such rights can ensure that they are enforced.
The obligations imposed by the TRIPs Agreement must be enforced by the contracting
parties within one year of the creation of the WTO.
In order to honour its commitments, the Community will have to amend its current
legislation in this area along the lines detailed in the annex, though compliance with some
of the obligations will be the responsibility of the Member States.
9. Plurilateral agreements
The Final Act of the Uruguay Round also contains the plurilateral agreements concluded
under GATT auspices.
(a) Sectoral agriculture agreements
The International Dairy Agreement and the International Bovine Meat Agreement were
not covered by the Uruguay Round negotiations. They appear in the Final Act unchanged
from their Tokyo Round formats of 1979.
The incorporation of plurilateral agreements into the WTO system, including its dispute
settlement procedures, is binding for members^who are party to the agreements concerned.
(b) Civil aircraft
When the Uruguay Round proper was concluded, it was decided to prolong the
negotiations on the revision of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft by another year.
Pending the expiry of that deadline in May 1995, the 1979 Agreement produced by the
Tokyo Round will remain in force.
Needless to say, no changes in legislation are necessary at this stage.
(c) Public procurement
A new Agreement on Government Procurement was successfully concluded.
