Certain special points should be mentioned:
(a) The "special safeguard provisions"
These provisions allow a minimum level of protection to be
maintained against the adverse effects on the market of the
conversion of the former import restrictions into customs duties
("tarification"). They therefore only apply to products
specifically identified in the final schedules. They must not be
confused with the safeguard provisions traditionally appearing in
all the basic Regulations; in fact, they involve a system which is
additional to the import duty and allow the latter to be increased
if certain conditions specified in the Agreement are met.
Accordingly, a specific article has been introduced, providing a
suitable legal basis for making use, at the right time, of the
possibilities afforded by this system. The extent to which the
system will be used depends on the market conditions applying for
the various products.
(b) Standard safeguard provisions
The standard safeguard provisions appearing hitherto in the basic
Regulations are maintained. However, the Agreement on Safeguards
contains reinforced all-sector arrangements specifying the
conditions under which they may be applied. A reference to these
rules has accordingly been included in the articles in question,
which have also been adapted to take account of the division of
competence mentioned in A.
(c) Specific arrangements for raw sugar for refining and molasses
Tarification as provided for in the Agreement could result in raw
sugar for refining and molasses being subject to an import charge
which could jeopardize supplies of such products to processing
industries in the Community. Accordingly, a special mechanism has
been introduced to permit the application of the duty entered in
the CCT to be suspended where the price recorded on the world
market exceeds a certain level.
* >
(d) Special arrangements on prices applying
For certain products (e.g. some cereals and rice), the Agreement
involves a level of protection, lower than that provided by the
CCT, which is dependent on import prices. Similarly, for certain
fruit and vegetables, must and grape juice, the import charge
depends on the entry price. In this respect, certain special rules
or necessary derogations from the CCT have been laid down,
implementation and details being left to the detailed rules of
application, which will have to deal in particular with the thorny
problem of controls. The present system of minimum import prices
remains in force for dried grapes and processed cherries until
1 January 2000.
(e) Management measures for beef and veal
The Agreement's ban on quantitative import restrictions requires
the repeal of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1157/92 of 28 April
1992, which at present serves as a legal basis for the erga omnes
limitation on imports of young bovine animals. As that measure is
of special importance for maintaining balance on the market for
beef and veal in the Community, the Commission will deal with the
matter during the renegotiation of the Europe Agreements with
certain East European countries.
2. Access to the Community market
In this context, the term "market access" covers all the conditions
under which imports may take place at reduced or zero duty. A
distinction should be made in principle between agreements concluded
with certain third countries containing preferential conditions
granted by the Community, current access within the meaning of the
Agreement (which includes part of the abovementioned agreements) and
minimum access.
In view of the high number of quotas in question and in order to
ensure their implementation as effectively as possible, a uniform
approach has been adopted for all cases, whatever their history. For
the sake of simplification and efficiency, this approach provides
that, on the basis of the international agreements concluded by the
Council or of autonomous acts of the latter and in accordance with the
conditions stipulated therein, the opening and administration of
•tariff quotas are to be carried out by the Commission in accordance
with the Management Committee procedure. A similar approach was
adopted for the administration of the quotas opened recently as a
result of the Soya Panel (Regulation (EC) No 774/94). Naturally, this
uniform procedural approach does not imply that the detailed rules
will be the same for all product groups.
M
As regards the market organization for bananas, the "GATT" proposal
involves taking over the framework agreement with certain countries in
Latin America. In accordance with the general approach in Regulation
(EEC) No 404/93, certain aspects of the allocation of tariff quotas
are incorporated in the Regulation.
C. Export arrangements
1. General
The export arrangements resulting from the Agreement provide for a
reduction in forthcoming years in the subsidies which may be granted
on agricultural products exported from the Community as such or after
processing. The reduction is to be made in accordance with rules
concerning the sums granted for all such exports and the quantities of
products exported as such(3). The arrangements must be applied in
such a way as to permit verification of compliance with those limits
for a period of 12 months, to commence in principle on 1 July 1995
and, in the case of other products (rice, wine, olive oil and sugar)
at later dates.
The Commission considers that compliance with limits on the value of
refunds may be monitored:
- when refunds are fixed,
- on the basis of advance fixing authorized by the Commission or of
tenders accepted in response to invitations to tender,
- on the basis of information provided by the Member States on
licences issued, refunds granted being compulsorily fixed in
advance, and
- on the basis of information provided to the EAGGF relating to
payments made by national bodies. Using such information, it should
be possible to charge each payment made to the EAGGF financial year
during which export formalities were completed.
As a result no other specific mechanisms need be introduced to ensure
compliance with limits on value..
2. Compliance with limits on quantity
As regards limits on quantity, the Agreement provides that compliance
must be demonstrated in terms of the quantities qualifying for export
•refunds for which export licences have been issued during the
marketing year in question.
(3) Limits on quantity do not apply to non-Annex II products.
19
(a) The aim of the "GATT" proposal is to ensure monitoring of the
quantities exported using export licences. Accordingly, such
licences will become compulsory where products covered by a refund
application are exported. This does not rule out the possibility
that, for certain product groups where such arrangements already
exist, export licences may also be required for purposes of
statistical monitoring of trade where export takes place without
any refund being granted. It remains to be decided whether
monitoring of the quantities exported will mean limiting the
duration of validity of export licences to the curent marketing
year or whether monitoring can be based on licences issued during
the marketing year. The detailed rules for the application of the
licence arrangements, and in particular the conditions
specifically relating to the issuing, term of validity and
transferability of licences, will be laid down, as at present, in
accordance with the Management Committee procedure for the product
group concerned.
Clearly, compliance with limits on quantity under the Agreement
calls for mechanisms to prevent any overrun. As the choice of
measures to be taken depends on the specific situation and the
requirements of the market in each product, the "GATT" proposal
does not dictate the methods to be used for checking quantities
available.
(b) One possible option is to determine export refunds by invitation
to tender. Here too, the "GATT" proposal does not dictate the
procedures to be adopted; refunds could also be fixed periodically
as they are now.
(c) It is the Commission's intention to select the approach which
involves the least red tape and is best adapted to the specific
situation of the product group concerned. This is why the "GATT"
proposal lays down flexible legal bases which allow the most
suitable solution to be sought for each product group, in
particular to make maximum use of the latitude offered by the GATT
Agreements and, where appropriate, for the arrangements to be
amended in the light of experience in applying them. This approach
is, moreover, in line with the way the Commission has hitherto
exercised the competence it has enjoyed under the arrangements in
force to date.
h
(d) Some points should be mentioned:
- there are exceptions from the general arrangements:
* for exports under food-aid operations, which are not subject
to any limits on quantity or value,
* for agricultural products exported in the form of goods not
listed in Annex II to the EC Treaty, such goods not being
subject to any limit on quantity;
- it is necessary to limit the scope for speculation and to create
a linkage with limits on value; accordingly, it is proposed to
make advance fixing compulsory, including reference to the
destination but allowing changes to another destination within
the same geographical area at the same refund rate;
- for certain products, the Agreement sets the quantities which
may be exported with payment of refunds at a level which, in the
light of experience gained, is unlikely to be exceeded. The
Regulation takes account of this by making provision for the
Commission, in accordance with the Management Committee
procedure, to relax the constraints laid down in this respect
for the products concerned to the extent appropriate;
- the pre-financing arrangements should be adapted at a later
stage, in particular on account of negative experience in
applying them and with a view to ruling out fraud when they are
applied.
D. Other provisions on trade
1. The provisions on inward processing arrangements have been maintained
without any substantial change.
2. The articles oh the prohibition of measures having an effect
equivalent to customs duties and quantitative restrictions and
measures having an equivalent effect have been adapted to the new
arrangements.
3. The article on shortages in supply has been adapted to the extent
necessary to take account of the abolition of threshold prices.

III. INCLUSION OF THE TRIPS AGREEMENT
For the first time the GATT Agreements lay down provisions on the
protection of intellectual property rights. Under this heading there
are specific provisions on the protection of designations of origin.
The Community regulations in force lay down rules on designations of
origin in several areas:
- for wine (quality wine psr),
- for spirituous beverages, and
- more generally, for certain agricultural and food products (in
Regulation (EEC) No 2081/92).
All these Community regulations (except those on wine) contain a
reservation relating to international agreements concluded by the
Community. Since the TRIPS agreement contains special arrangements on
wine and spirit drinks, specific provisions must be incorporated into
the relevant regulations. As a result, when the various Community
arrangements are applied, due account may be taken of the obligations
and restrictions resulting from the TRIPS Agreement.
IV. VETERINARY AND PLANT-HEALTH LEGISLATION
In the veterinary and plant-health fields, the provisions in force
permit the rules in the relevant Agreement to be applied. However,
Directive 77/93/EEC on protective measures against the introduction
into the Community of organisms harmful to plants or plant products
must be amended to ensure uniform application of the arrangements with
regard to third countries.
V. ENTRY INTO FORCE
In accordance with the Commission's policy decision that the results
of the Uruguay Round should be implemented as a whole, the proposals
refer to a Council decision on entry into force which will apply to
all the sectors concerned.
