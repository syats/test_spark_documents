The main outcome of the negotiations was to extend the scope of the Agreement to
embrace procurement of supplies, works and services by national and local government
agencies, and by public undertakings operating in the utility sectors (ports, airports, water,
electricity and urban transport).
Here too, the Community approach was conditioned by the progress achieved in the
creation of the Single Market. Consequently, the revision of the Agreement on Public
Procurement does not entail any major changes to current Community legislation.
However, the Community is engaged in a series of bilateral negotiations on entities to be
subject to the disciplines. The results of these negotiations will be submitted to the
Council for adoption on a case-by-case basis, as the talks are concluded.
It is possible that some of these bilateral agreements will entail making some minor
changes to the legislation. Given that parties to the new Agreement on Public
Procurement will not be required to enforce its provisions until 1 January 1996, and that
the bilateral agreements will enter into force on the same date or even later, the
Commission reserves the right if necessary to return to the implementation of the public
procurement aspects of the Uruguay Round at a later date.
10. Other agreements
Negotiations for the Multilateral Agreement for Steel are still continuing so no text is
included in the Final Act and no amendments to the legislation are therefore necessary
for the time being.
in. Procedural aspects
The Commission proposal to the Council for a Decision concluding the Uruguay Round
agreements recommends referral to Parliament under the assent procedure, since the Final
Act, by virtue of the Agreement establishing the WTO, provides for a "specific
institutional framework" within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 228(3)
of the Union Treaty.
In any case, the Uruguay Round agreements undeniably constitute international
agreements of significant importance for the Community within the terms of the Stuttgart
Solemn Declaration.
In the interests of political and legislative consistency, therefore, it would also be sensible
to submit to Parliament for its opinion the acts implementing the agreements.
Since those acts are based on Article 113, however, that move is optional.
When the package of legislation is,sent to Parliament the attention of the House should
be drawn to the importance of enabling the Community to honour its international
commitments as from 1 January next year.
