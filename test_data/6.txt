In order to prevent over- and under-invoicing and fraud in the importing third country,
Member States shall verify that pre-shipment inspection entities conduct price verification1
according to the following conditions.
a. pre-shipment inspection entities shall only reject a contract price agreed between an
exporter and an importer if they can demonstrate that their findings of an
unsatisfactory price are based on a;
 verification process which is in conformity with
the criteria set out in sub-paragraphs (b) through (e),
b. the pre-shipment inspection entity shall base its price comparison for the verification
of the export price on the price(s) of identical or similar goods offered for export
from the same country of exportation at or about the same time, under competitive
and comparable conditions of ^sale, in conformity with customary commercial
practices and net of any applicable standard discounts. Such comparison shall be
based on the following:
i. only prices providing a valid basis of comparison shall be used, taking into
account the relevant economic factors pertaining to the country of importation
and a country or countries used for price comparison;
ii. the pre-shipment inspection entity shall not rely upon the price of goods offered
for export to different countries of importation to arbitrarily impose the lowest
price upon the shipment;
iii. the pre-shipment inspection entity shall take into account the specific elements
listed in sub-paragraph (c);
iv. at any stage in the process described above, the pre-shipment inspection entity
shall provide the exporter with an opportunity to explain the price;
c. when conducting price verification, pre-shipment inspection entities shall make
appropriate allowances for the terms of the sales contract and generally applicable
adjusting factors pertaining to the transaction; these factors shall include but not be
limited to the commercial level and quantity of the sale, delivery periods and
conditions, price escalation clauses, quality specifications, special design features,
special shipping or packing specifications, order size, spot sales, seasonal influences,
licence or other intellectual property fees, and services rendered as part of the
contract if these are not customarily invoiced separately; they shall also include
certain elements relating to the exporter's price, such as the contractual relationship
between the exporter and importer;

iv. arbitrary or fictitious prices or values.
Article 6
In order to avoid unnecessary delays for exporters, Member States shall incite preshipment
inspection entities to use simplified verification procedures, where appropriate,
in particular to exclude the review of prices in certain cases. In establishing these
simplified procedures, however, account shall be taken of the obligation by Member States
and pre-shipment inspection entities to carry out the activity in a non-discriminatory
manner.
Article 7
If the pre-shipment inspection entity does not observe the conditions set out in Articles 4
and 5 of this Directive, or if the entity does not comply with the procedures set out in
Article 9, the authorities of a Member State shall notify the Commission and the other
Member States of such non-observance or non-compliance and may have recourse to the
procedure foreseen by Article 4 of Council Regulation2641/84 (EC)2
.
Article 8
Member States shall provide third countries, if requested, technical assistance directed
towards the achievement of the objectives of the agreement on pre-shipment inspection in
the WTO mutually agreed terms, or how to do without them.
