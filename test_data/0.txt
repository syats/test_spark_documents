The European Community is one of the participating parties in the negotiations making
up the eighth round of multilateral trade negotiations held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). The Uruguay Round negotiations, as
they were known, were concluded by the Trade Negotiations Committee in Geneva on
15 December 1993. The Final Act embodying the results of the Uruguay Round
multilateral trade negotiations (hereinafter the Final Act) was formally signed on behalf
of the Community by the President of the Council, Mr Pangalos, and Sir Leon Brittan,
Member of the Commission, in Marrakesh on 15 April.
The Commission has officially presented the Council with a proposal for a decision on
the conclusion of the results of the Uruguay Round Trade Negotiations.1
 The Council has
yet to act on this point.
Like its principal trading partners, the Community gave its official approval for the
establishment of the World Trade Organization and the other results of the Uruguay
Round to take effect at multilateral level at the earliest possible opportunity, i.e.
1 January 1995.
An implementation conference will be held in Geneva early in December to this end.
The Commission is convinced that any further delay in fulfilling its international
obligations would be severely prejudicial to the Community's international prestige and
credibility.

2. Grounds for the proposed approach
The Commission considers it appropriate, as matters now stand, to implement forthwith
all the additions and amendments to Community legislation required by the Final Act.
Aside from the Community's formal adoption of the results of the Uruguay Round and,
consequently, from its accession to the World Trade-Organization as a founder member,
the prompt adoption of this decision by the Council would also allow the Community to
honour its commitments to its international trading partners.
Pending lodging of the Community's official instruments of acceptance with the World
Trade Organization, the current state of affairs in GATT would thus continue.

 Irrespective of the fulfilment of commitments made under its auspices, the General
Agreement has not been submitted for ratification by the parties.
II Legislative aspects
Examination of the Final Act shows that several measures it contains are already
adequately covered by existing Community legislation.
However, other measures do require the Community either to adopt new legislative acts
or to amend existing Community law.
This memorandum ssets out the reasons for the entry into force of all the acts required to
implement the results of the Uruguay Round and summarizes the main grounds justifying
the acts listed in the annex to the proposed implementing decision.
In addition, each of the acts listed in the annex is preceded by its own explanatory
memorandum giving detailed observations on the act concerned.
1. Simultaneous entry into force
Mainly at the Community's insistence, the Punta Del Este Declaration, which launched
the Uruguay Round trade negotiations, established the principle of globality as one of the
"guiding principles of the negotiations".
From the point of view of the Community's objectives it was thought appropriate that
"the launching, the conduct and the implementation of the outcome of the negotiations
shall be treated as parts of a single undertaking".2
The Council was regularly informed of progress and consistently underlined the point that
the result of the Uruguay Rpund should be a "comprehensive and balanced outcome".
The Commission also believes that only a global assessment will allow the Uruguay
Round's contribution to the Community to be fairly judged.
Most of the Community's partners in the negotiations have adopted procedures aimed at
guaranteeing the "globality" of the outcome.
On the multilateral front, accession to the World Trade Organization is subject to
acceptance in full of the Final Act (see Agreement establishing the WTO, Articles XI and
XII).
Consideration of these factors led the Commission to propose at the Council meeting of
15 April 1994 that the implementing legislation be presented as a whole in the form of
a single legislative act.
However, in order to facilitate discussion in the various Council committees, the
Commission decided on the approach outlined here in which the political unity of the
