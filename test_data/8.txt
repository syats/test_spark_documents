EXPLANATORY MEMORANDUM
I. INTRODUCTION
Several of the agreements which the Community has negotiated under the
Uruguay Round (hereinafter referred to as the "GATT Agreements")(*)
involve adapting some of the legislation implementing the common
agricultural policy. These are in particular:
- the Agreement on Agriculture (hereinafter referred to as the
"Agreement"),
the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary
Measures,
the Agreement on Safeguards, and
- the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(hereinafter referred to as the "TRIPS Agreement").
As regards agriculture, these Agreements cover the following aspects:
the internal support arrangements,
the arrangements on trade with third countries,
a system for the protection of designations of origin (part of the
TRIPS Agreement),
arrangements concerning veterinary and plant health measures affecting
international trade.
The attached proposals for Regulations(2) contain the provisions
necessary for incorporating into Community law the rules referred to
in the last three indents above. As regards the arrangements for
internal support, the Commission considers that specific provisions
should not be introduced into the market organizations. The relevant
rules in the Agreement should be taken into account when prices are
fixed and aid measures are adopted for future marketing years.
In order to safeguard the possibility of the necessary measures being
taken in trade relations with third countries vis-à-vis which the
Commission has no obligations under the GATT Agreements, the "GATT"
proposal provides a suitable legal basis.
(1) See proposal for a Council Decision con the conclusion of the results
of the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations (1986-94),
COM(94) 143 final of 15 May 1994.
(2) there are two draft Regulations: one covering all the amendments based
on Article 43 of the EC Treaty (referred to as the "GATT" proposal)
and one based on Articles 43 and 100a of the Treaty.
^
These proposals do not cover the following:
- issues arising from the GATT Agreements and affecting the
preferential agreements concluded with third countries (e.g. Lomé
Convention) and the enlargement of the Community, which are still to
be dealt with;
- the agri-monetary arrangements for the new system; these will be
dealt with in the report on the agri-monetary system which the
Commission is to present to the Council before the end of 1994.
II. TRADE ARRANGEMENTS
A. General
The GATT Agreements centre the trade arrangements on the following
main points:
- tarification,
- access to the Community market,
- safeguard provisions,
- the export subsidy system.
The "GATT" proposal is based on the following principles:
- careful compliance with obligations under the GATT Agreements,
- maximum flexibility for management,
- full use of possibilities offered by the GATT Agreements,
- as little change as possible to the organization of the markets in
the various agricultural products.
However, it has proved inevitable to make amendments to almost all the
provisions in the basic Regulations relating to trade with third
countries. The abolition of variable levies not only entails
abolishing the rules for their calculation but also calls for the
articles relating thereto to be adapted. This also holds true for
export refunds, which can only be granted subject to the quantitative
and financial limits laid down in the Agreement.
Nevertheless, this proposal largely confines' itself to incorporating
in the basic Regulations the main principles on the implementation of
the GATT Agreements and entrusting the Commission with the task of
implementing them in line with the needs of the various sectors. This
approach, which is based in particular on the heed to preserve
sufficient flexibility for day-to-day management, takes account in
particular of the fact that most obligations to be met are defined
precisely in the Agreements.
ir
When making these amendments, the Commission has also held to the
principle recognized at the time of the consolidation of the
Regulation on the market organization for cereals (Regulation (EEC)
No 1766/92) under the reform of the CAP and applied on several
occasions since then, to the effect that competence for legislation
should be shared between the Council and the Commission so as to
result in two levels only: on the one hand the provisions adopted by
the Council in accordance with the procedure laid down in
Article 43(2) of the EC Treaty and, on the other, the detailed rules
of application adopted by the Commission in accordance with the
Management Committee procedure.
As regards the implementation of the GATT Agreements in legislation,
the Commission has opted for an approach by product group which
preserves the traditional structure of the market organizations, as
set out in particular in the basic Regulations, and at the same time
ensures the transparency of the solutions chosen. The "GATT" proposal
accordingly consists in concise substantive provisions covering all
product groups and comprising in particular a legal basis for the
adoption of the necessary transitional rules, the annexes to which
contain the adjustments to be made for the various sectors. It also
provides for the repeal of the regulations laying down general rules.
B. Import arrangements
1. Import charges (tarification)
The fundamental change introduced by the new import arrangements is
the replacement of variable charges (levies, compensatory amounts,
etc.) and other types of non-tariff import restrictions (quantitative
restrictions, voluntary restraint agreements, etc.) by stable,
degressive tariffs. The introduction of such tariffs will be effected,
in legal terms, by means of a suitable amendment to the Common Customs
Tariff, the relevant figures being set out in the final schedules
presented by the Community to the Director-General of GATT and forming
a legal part of the Agreement. In the basic Regulations, it will
accordingly be sufficient to refer to the duties entered in the CCT.
The replacement of variable charges by the CCT duties implies the
repeal of all the rules which refer to their calculation, i.e. in
particular all provisions on the fixing of threshold prices, reference
prices, etc. and the rules laid down for the calculation of variable
•charges applying to derived products.
