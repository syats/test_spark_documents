(c) Rules of Origin
The Community entered negotiations with no specific demands of its own. It did,
however, successfully push for the principle of a single set of rules of origin at
international level, along with the notion that the last substantial transformation should
determine origin. The criteria listed in Annex II of the Agreement on Rules of Origin
correspond to current Community practice and do not affect the Community's preferential
rules of origin.
Part IV of the Agreement on Rules of Origin sets out a work programme for
harmonization entailing further negotiations under the GATT. Work will be started as
soon as the World Trade Organization is set up and is planned to last three years at this
stage.
The major changes to Community legislation will therefore not have to be introduced
until 1998 at the earliest. In the meantime, there are the procedural changes relating to
information on origin, which come under implementing arrangements for the Community
Customs Code.
The implementing regulation is Commission legislation and is being amended in line with
the results of the Uruguay Round. It could be brought into force whenever appropriate,
and does not need to be included among the proposals presented for adoption by the
Council.
(d) Import licences
The Agreement on Import Licensing Procedures reached in the Tokyo Round has been
revised, though the changes are mainly technical.
On the substantive side, the nature of trade-restricting effects is now spelled out. The
transparency clauses and the non-automatic licensing procedures have also been markedly
improved.
Upon examination, however, these changes do not appear to entail any amendments to
Community legislation as it currently stands.
4. Textiles and clothing
The negotiations on bringing textiles and clothing under the GATT, subject to
strengthened rules and disciplines, was one of the major issues of the Uruguay Round.
The Agreement finally reached and incorporated into the Final Act meets the
Community's objectives in this area via a twin process of liberalization and integration
spread over three distinct phases.
Some amendments to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993 on
common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries will be
necessary to implement the Agreement. The details and the logic behind the amendments
are discussed in the specific Explanatory Memorandum on textiles which is annexed to
the attached Decision.
5. Agriculture
The hopes and fears of the Uruguay Round, from start to finish, were largely bound up
with one issue - agriculture.
The talks resulted in a string of provisions on agriculture which are largely, though not
exclusively, contained in the Agreement on Agriculture set out in the Final Act.
The Community's commitments in this sector will require a number of amendments to
Community legislation and certain transitional measures.
The changes, and the reasons for them, are detailed in a specific Explanatory
Memorandum annexed to the Decision.
6. Rules and disciplines
(a) Technical barriers to trade
The new'Agreement constitutes a major revision of the Code that emerged from the
Tokyo Round. It generally has a clearer structure, stronger disciplines, and wider coverage
in respect of those involved in standardization, drafting technical regulations, and
evaluating products' conformity with the standards in question.
More specifically, the new Agreement contains a Code of Practice setting out rules to be
observed in establishing voluntary standards, which apply to both public and private
bodies. It also takes an important step towards striking a better balance between rights and
obligations by applying GATT disciplines to large local authorities. The introduction of
the principle of proportionality is another major innovation, as is the inclusion of
production processes and methods in the scope of the agreement.
The changes made to the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade during the Uruguay
Round negotiations broadly reflect the Community approach to standardization as it has
emerged from work on the Single Market. No changes will therefore need to be made to
the Community legislation currently in force to ensure compliance with the Agreement.
(b) Trade-related investment measures
The Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs) clarifies
the GATT provisions in this area, in that the contracting parties undertake not to apply
any measures that are incompatible with Articles 111(4) and XI(1) of the GATT. There
is an illustrative, i.e. non-exhaustive, list of definitions of the measures covered by the
agreement.
The section in Article III on breaches of national treatment obligations defines local
content and limited manufacturing requirements, while the section in Article XI on
breaches of the obligation to abolish quantitative restrictions lists domestic sales, product
mandating and trade balancing requirements.
Article 5 of the TRIMs Agreement allows the industrialized countries a transitional period
of two years to dismantle measures covered by the Agreement. However, this period of
grace will be granted only for measures of which GATT is notified within 90 days of the
creation of the WTO.
Community legislation is unaffected by the TRIMs Agreement, although the Member
States are advised to take note of the terms of the agreement.
