outcome is embodied in legal form by the attached decision on simultaneous entry into
force.
This decision lays down that all the acts required for the implementation of the results of
the Uruguay Round, which are listed in full in its annex, will come into force legally in
the Community simultaneously on 1 January 1995. The entry into force of each act is
therefore subject to the adoption of this decision simultaneously implementing all the
other acts.
2. Commitments on customs duties for products not covered by the agriculture
offer
The negotiations on customs duties in the Uruguay Round resulted in the deposit by the
Community of a new schedule of tariff concessions.
The commitments entered into represent in total an average 30% reduction in the rate of
customs duties applicable to imports from other GATT contracting parties.
The participating parties in the Uruguay Round agreed to implement the first stage of
reductions with effect from 1 January 1995.
Pursuant to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2658/87 of 25 July 1987 the tariff to be
applied as from 1 January of the following year must be published by 31 October at the
latest. It seems unlikely that procedural delays would allow adoption of the tariff resulting
from the Uruguay Round by that date, but publication of the pre-Uruguay Round tariff
on the prescribed date would probably cause some confusion amongst businesses and lead
to doubts inside and outside Europe as to the Community's determination to honour its
commitments under the Uruguay Round.
To avoid giving the wrong impression and damaging the Community's prestige
internationally, the Commission considers it appropriate to waive the obligation to publish
and, instead, to publish the tariff fixed in the Uruguay Round by way of information in
the C series of the Official Journal on the prescribed date.
The decision on tariffs is a key element and integral part of the overall outcome of the
Uruguay Round. It is important, therefore, that it should be given due consideration
along with the other results. Likewise, the tariff concessions granted by the Community
in the Uruguay Round should take effect on the same date as the other commitments
entered into during the negotiations.
3. Non-tariff commitments
The results of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade negotiations also include important
non-tariff provisions.
(a) Customs valuation
Leaving aside a small number of essentially technical amendments, the Agreement on
Implementation of Article VII of the General Agreement (Rules on Customs Valuation)
was further clarified in two Decisions on customs valuation formally adopted at the
c
ministerial meeting in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 and incorporated into the Final Act
embodying the results of the Uruguay Round.
The Decision on Texts Relating to Minimum Values and Imports by Sole Agents, Sole
Distributors and Sole Concessionnaires is mainly addressed to developing countries and
requires no action on the Community's part.
The Decision Regarding Cases where Customs Administrations Have Reason to Doubt the
Truth or Accuracy of the Declared Value, on the other hand, provides added protection
for importers by stipulating that customs administrations must give reasons in writing for
doubting the declared value, and giving importers a right of reply.
These safeguards do not exist in Community law as it stands. As a result, Commission
Regulation No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993, laying down provisions for the implementation
of the Community Customs Code, needs to be amended.
Since this is, however, a matter for the Commission, no amendments need be tabled for
adoption by the Council, so none are included in the Annexes to the Decision.
(b) Preshipment Inspection
A number of developing countries lacking adequate customs facilities have given
private-sector companies the task of verifying the price, quality and quantity of goods sent
to them. This practice, with private firms exercising public authority, is known as
preshipment inspection'.
Preshipment inspection was included in discussions on non-tariff matters at the
Community's suggestion.
The Agreement incorporated into the Final Act applies basic GATT tenets such as nondiscrimination
and transparency to the practices of preshipment inspection companies. It
spells out in detail a set of obligations governing all aspects of preshipment inspection,
paying special attention to price verification. It also introduces a two-tier dispute
settlement system for private parties and Governments who are signatories to the GATT.
Disputes between the inspection bodies and exporters will be settled by binding
arbitration. Governments, however, will be fully liable, under the GATT dispute
settlement procedure, for seeing that the Agreement on Preshipment Inspection is
complied with.
Community law has no rules on preshipment inspection, although it does exist in some
of the Member States' national legislation.
In view of the nature of the commitments made under the Agreement on Preshipment
Inspection in the Uruguay Round, the various national authorities should implement the
provisions, with a Council Directive to guide them.
