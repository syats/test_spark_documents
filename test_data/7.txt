Explanatory Memorandum
1. The present proposal amending Regulation 3030/93 on common rules for imports
of textiles is designed to ensure effective implementation of the Agreement on Textiles
and Clothing of the World Trade Organization.
2. The WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing necessitates three types of
changes to Regulation 3030/93:
(i) the safeguard provisions (Article 10) have to be brought into line with
those of the new WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (Article 6);
(ii) the Community quantitative limits contained in Annex V affecting imports
from members of the WTO will have to be adjusted at the beginning of each of the 3
phases of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing to reflect the higher annual
quota growth rates foreseen; similarly at such time as the European Union integrates
products subject to quantitative limits such products should be deleted from Annex V;
(iii) as and when certain of the third countries listed in Annex VIII (flexibility
provisions) become members of the WTO, the respective "cap" on cumulative use of
flexibility provisions indicated in column 8 of the table will have to be deleted since
Article 2 paragraph 16 of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing stipulates that
there shall be no limit to the "combined use of swing, carry over and carry forward".
Since it is not clear at this stage whether and when all the third countries listed in the
Annexes will become members of the WTO and thereby benefit from the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing, the Commission will adopt the necessary technical amendments to
the Annexes to Regulation 3030/93 referred to in points (ii) and (iii) above via the
Textiles Committee procedure laid down in Article 17 of the Regulation.
To this end and for reasons of clarity it is proposed to delete the reference to the quota
years 1993-1995 in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the Regulation since for WTO Members the
quota increases will be automatic for the next 10 years.
3. With regard to the safeguard clause, it is proposed to maintain the existing
language on the basket exit mechanism contained in the present paragraphs 1 and 2 of
Article 10 of the Regulation and to add clauses corresponding to the new provisions of
the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. The reason for this is that of the countries
listed in Annex IX which are currently subject to the basket exit mechanism a number of
important suppliers (eg China, Taïwan, Vietnam, ex USSR) will probably not be
members of the WTO upon the date of its entry into force but join in the near future.
Therefore, it will be necessary to maintain the current safeguard mechanism to cover the
interim period. The Commission proposes two parallel safeguard provisions in the
Regulation and as and when each of the third countries listed in Annex IX benefits from
the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, that country will be deleted from Annex
IX via the Textiles Committee procedure (Article 17 of the Regulation).

Proposal for a Council Regulation amending *94/ 022 7 ( Acc }
COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 1993
on common rules for imports of certain textile products from third countries
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular
Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament,
Whereas the Community has signed the Final act of the Uruguay Round of GATT
negotiations setting up a World Trade Organization, (hereinafter referred to as the WTO);
Whereas it is necessary to amend the safeguard provisions laid down in Regulation
(EEC) No 3030/93 of 12 October 19931
 on common rules for imports of certain textile
products from third countries, as last amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No.
195/94 of 12 January 19942
, in order to bring them into line with the new safeguard
provisions contained in the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing with regard to
imports from WTO Members;
Whereas the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing also stipulates the annual growth
rates which will be applied automatically to remaining Community quantitative limits on
imports from WTO Members for a period of 10 years following entry into force of the
WTO; whereas it is therefore appropriate that the Community quantitative limits foreseen
in Annex V of Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 on imports from WTO Members should be
amended at each stage of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing via the
procedure foreseen in Article 17 of the Regulation and paragraph i of Article 2 of the
Regulation should be amended to that effect.

Article 1
Article 10 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 3030/93 is replaced by the following:
"Article 10
Safeguard measures
1. Should imports into the Community of products falling within any given
category, not subject to the quantitative limits set out in Annex V and originating in one
of the countries listed in Annex IX exceed, in relation to the preceding calendar year's
total imports into the Community of products in the same category, the percentages
indicated in the Table appearing in Annex IX, such imports may be made subject to
quantitative limits under the conditions laid down in this Article.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply where the percentages specified therein have been
reached as a result of a fall in total imports into the Community, and not as a result of an
increase in exports of products originating in the supplier country concerned.
3. Where the Commission, upon its own initiative or at the request of a Member
State, considers that the conditions set out in paragraph 1 are fulfilled and that a given
category of products should be made subject to a quantitative limit:
(a) it shall open consultations with the supplier country concerned in accordance with
the procedure specified in Article 16 with a view to reaching an arrangement or joint
conclusions on a suitable level of restriction for the category or products in question;
(b) pending a mutually satisfactory solution, the Commission shall, as a general rule,
request the supplier country concerned to limit exports of the products in the category
concerned to the Community, for a provisional period of three months from the date on
which the request for consultations is made. Such provisional limit shall be established at
25% of the level of imports during the previous calender year, or 25% of the level
resulting from the application of the formula set out in paragraph 1, whichever is the
higher;
(c) it may, pending the outcome of the requested consultations, apply to the imports
of the category of products in question quantitative limits identical to those requested of
the supplier country pursuant to point (b). These measures shall be without prejudice to
the definitive arrangements to be made by the Community, taking into account the results
of the consultations.
4. (a) Should imports into the Community of textile products not subject to the
quantitative limits set out in Annex V and originating in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic,
Hungary, Poland, Romania or the Slovak Republic take place in such increased
quantities, or under such conditions, so as to cause serious damage or actual threat
thereof, to the Community's production of like or directly competitive products, such
imports may be made subject to quantitative limits under the conditions laid down in the
Additional Protocols with these countries.
25
(b) The provisions of paragraph 3, shall also apply in such cases except that
the provisional limit referrred to in paragraph 3 (b) shall be established at 25%, at least,
of the level of imports during the twelve-month period terminating two months, or where
data is not available three months, preceding the month in which the request for
consultations is made.
5. (a) With regard to products not subject to the quantitative limits set out in
Annex V and originating in countries which are Members of the World Trade
Organization, safeguard action may be taken where it is demonstrated that a particular
product is being imported into the Comunity in such increased quantities as to cause
serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing like and/or
directly competitive products. Serious damage or actual threat thereof must demonstrably
be caused by such increased quantities in total imports of that product and not by such
other factors as technological changes or changes in consumer preference.
(b) In making a determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, as
referrred to in paragraph (a) the effect of those imports on the state of the particular
industry shall be examined, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables
as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages,
employment, domestic prices, profits and investment.
(c) The third country or countries, Member(s) of the World Trade
Organization to whom serious damage, or actual threat thereof, as referred to in
paragraph (a) is attributed, shall be determined on the basis of a sharp and substantial
increase in imports, actual or imminent and on the level of imports as compared with
imports from other sources, market share and import and domestic prices at a comparable
stage of commercial transaction.
6. Where the Commission, upon its own initiative or at the request of a Member
State, considers that the conditions set out in paragraph 5 are fulfilled and that the
products in question should be made subject to a quantitative limit:
(a) it shall open consultations with the supplier country concerned in accordance with
the procedure specified in Article 16 with a view to reaching an arrangement or joint
conclusions on a suitable level of restriction for the products in question;
(b) it may, pending the outcome of the consultations and in highly unusual and
critical circumstances where delay would cause damage which could be difficult to
repair, impose a provisional quantitative limit on the products in question. Such
provisional limit shall not be lower than the actual level of imports from the supplier
country during the twelve-month period terminating two months proceding the month in
which the request for consultations was made.
7. (a) Measures taken pursuant to paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 shall be the subject of a
Commission communication published without delay in the Official Journal of the
European Communities.
I o
(b) The Commission shall refer urgent cases to the Committee provided for in
Article 17 either at its own initiative or within five working days of receipt of a request
from a Member State or States setting out the reasons for the urgency and shall take a
decision within five working days of the end of the Committee's deliberation.
8. The consultations with the supplier country concerned which are provided for in
paragraphs 3, 4 and 6 may lead to an arrangement between that country and the
Community, on the introduction and the level of quantitative limits. Such arrangements
shall stipulate that the quantitative limits agreed be administered in accordance with a
double-checking system.
9. Should the parties be unable to reach a satisfactory solution within 60 days
following notification of the request for consultations, the Community shall have the
right to introduce a definitive quantitative limit at an annual level not lower than:
(a) in the case of supplier countries listed in Annex IX, the level resulting from the
application of the formula set out in paragraph 1 or 106% of the level of imports reached
during the calendar year preceding that in which imports exceeded the level resulting
from the application of the formula set out in paragraph 1 and gave rise to the request for
consultations, whichever is the higher.
(b) in the case of Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania or the
Slovak Republic, 110% of the imports for the twelve-month period tenninating two
months, or where data is not available three months, preceding the month in which the
request for consultations is made.
(c) in the case of supplier countries, members of the WTO, the actual level of imports
from the supplier country concerned during the twelve-month period terminating two
months preceding the month in which the request for consultations was made.
10. The annual level of the quantitative limits established in accordance with
paragraphs 3 to 6 or 9 may not be less than the level of imports into the Community in
1985 for Argentina, Brazil, Hong Kong, Pakistan, Peru, Sri Lanka and Uruguay, and in
1986 for Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Macao, Philippines, Singapore, South
Korea and Thailand, of products of the same category and originating in the same
supplier country.
11. The quantitative limits established under this Article shall not apply to products
which have already been dispatched to the Community provided that they were shipped
from the supplier country in which they originate for export to the Community before the
date of notification of the request for consultations.
